# Shared Types

This module contains relevant types shared between the service and the front-end to avoid repeating code and help sharing a common interface.

It only shared 2 different types:

## QuoteType
This type is the main interface describing how the data needs to be structured both on the backend and frontend.

```typescript
type QuoteType = {
    text: string,
    author: string
}
```

## ServiceResponseType
This is a simple type describing the structured of the returned data from the service. In other words, we're just stating that the service will return a list of quotes.

```typescript
type ServiceResponseType = QuoteType[]
```
